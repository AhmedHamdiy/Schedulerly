# 🤖 Process-Scheduling-Project
## 💻 Project Description:
Process scheduling is allocating resources to different processes so that they can be completed in an efficient and timely manner. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the use of resources, keep the CPU busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, and minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled. One more objective in multiprocessor systems is to ensure load balancing among different processors.
In this project you we have developed a program that simulates the operation of the process scheduler in a multiprocessor system and calculates some related statistics in order to help improve the overall scheduling system. . Made as a project for Data Structure course in the Computer Engineering Department first-year Cairo University Egypt.

## Conventions and team guidelines:

### 🆎 Naming : 
#### Minimize the use of abbreviations:
#### Do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.
##### int stlcntr = 7; ❌ 
##### int stealCounter = 7; ✅
#### Variables and Functions should be written in "camelCase".
        killOrphan(); ✅
#### Functions maybe start with verbs.
        moveToBLK(); ✅
#### Functions that return a bool should start with Is:
        isRDYEmpty() ✅

### 💬 Comments:
- use // syntax
- every non-obvious function definition should have a comment that describes what it is for.
- internal comments describe each part in the functions
